ðŸŒŸ I began my career as a software engineer with Subex and became a key contributor to a significant project involving the transformation of a .NET-based application into a Java web application. The application served as an essential tool for major Telecom operators, helping them identify revenue leaks within their systems.

ðŸ”§ As a Software Developer specializing in Java, I took on the responsibility of developing a software product called ROC Revenue Assurance. This product played a vital role in the Telecom industry, widely used by major Telecom Operators. My involvement in the project encompassed active participation in the Agile software development process, with a focus on requirement gathering, designing new modules, and implementing them.

ðŸš€ In my role, I actively engaged with customers and internal teams to gather essential data for change requests. I utilized my expertise to provide comprehensive solution descriptions for these requests, ensuring a clear understanding of the intended changes. Additionally, I also contributed in the design and development of new tasks, utilizing GWT ROCforms to implement necessary GUI changes. 
Through an Agile approach, I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to ensure the successful delivery of high-quality features.

ðŸ’¡ The collective effort resulted in the successful transformation of the application, enabling Telecom operators to effectively identify and resolve revenue leaks within their systems. The development and widespread adoption of the ROC Revenue Assurance product further solidified its position as an indispensable tool for major Telecom Operators.
