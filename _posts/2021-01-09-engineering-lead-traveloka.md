After gaining a lot of experience during my entrepreneurship journey, took an opportunity to join **Traveloka's early stage India team** as an Engineering Lead. 

üåç I played an instrumental role in setting up the **Traveloka's Xperience Supply platform**, which aimed to cater to attractions and activities inventories from multiple geographies covering South East Asia, Europe and Australia. The goal was to create a centralized system that would streamline inventory management and enhance user experience.

üìä Recognizing the need for a more efficient inventory management system, my objective was to build a new platform that could significantly **decrease the product onboarding time from days to minutes**. Additionally, I was entrusted with the responsibility of hiring and mentoring a culturally and technically diverse team of high-performing engineers located in both India and Indonesia.

üîß To achieve our objectives, I led the design and development of the new inventory management system. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I identified the pain points in the existing onboarding process and implemented streamlined workflows and automation along with my Senior fellow Engineers. 
Leveraging my expertise in technology and project management, I created a scalable and user-friendly platform that allowed for quick and seamless integration of multi-lingual attractions and activities inventories across globe. 

üë• Simultaneously, I actively engaged in the **recruitment and mentoring process**, ensuring the team comprised talented engineers who possessed both technical prowess and a cultural understanding.

‚ú® The implementation of the Xperience Supply platform and the new inventory management system yielded remarkable results. The product onboarding time was significantly reduced < 60 minutes, enabling faster and more efficient integration of inventories. 
This led to an enhanced user experience, as customers could access a broader range of offerings in a shorter timeframe. The platform's success further strengthened the Traveloka's position in the market even during the Covid19 times, attracting new partnerships and boosting revenue.
