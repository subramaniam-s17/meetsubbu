ðŸšŒ I have joined Redbus as an early team member of B2B platform, I played a crucial role in the development of a B2B platform used by bus operators, retail agents, and API partners. The objective was to create a robust and efficient system that would facilitate seamless operations and collaboration among stakeholders in the transportation industry.

ðŸ”§ Majorly my responsibility was transforming the existing monolith fleet management system into a modern and scalable Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) system. The goal was to enhance system flexibility, maintainability, and overall performance.

ðŸš€ Taking charge of the system transformation, I spearheaded the implementation of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) by breaking down the monolith into microservices. Leveraging my expertise in AWS services, I designed and built a high-available and scalable service infrastructure. 
This involved utilizing various AWS services and best practices to ensure reliability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization.

âœ¨ The successful conversion of the fleet management system into a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) yielded a great results. The new system architecture improved system flexibility, making it easier to introduce new features and functionalities. 
The implementation of a high-available and scalable service infrastructure enhanced system reliability and performance, ensuring uninterrupted operations. This led to increased bus operator and agent satisfaction, improved business efficiency, and strengthened partnerships with bus operators, retail agents, and API partners. 
The transition to the modernized system positioned the B2B platform as a leading solution in the transportation industry.
