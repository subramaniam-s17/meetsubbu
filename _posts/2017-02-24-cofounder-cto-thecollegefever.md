üåç On a random day, was having a casual discussion with a couple of friends about the need for a platform that would connect students from Tier 2 city colleges in India and enable them to showcase their talents, explore events, and participate in fests which happens in Tier 1 Colleges. 
Thanks to that casual discussion which have given the birth to **TheCollegeFever.com**

üöÄ With a passion for technology and community-building, I led the development of **TheCollegeFever.com as CoFounder and CTO**. Collaborating with a talented team, we created a user-friendly interface, robust backend infrastructure, and seamless event discovery and participation features. 

üíº Simultaneously, I embarked on the journey of fundraising, actively engaging with potential investors, showcasing the platform's capability, and successfully securing an angel funding of ~$250k.

üåü The result of our efforts was a thriving platform with approximately 50,000 daily active users, connecting students across India and empowering them to showcase their talents. The successful fundraising round provided the necessary financial backing to fuel the platform's growth and expansion. 
The vibrant Students Community not only fostered creativity, learning, and networking but also garnered positive feedback and engagement from students. This success positioned the platform as a go-to destination for students seeking to share their passions and discover new opportunities.
