A visionary engineering manager with a passion for innovation and a track record of driving exceptional results. My leadership style focuses on inspiring and motivating teams, fostering a collaborative and innovative environment that brings out the best in everyone.


Currently, I'm working with Gojek as an Engineering manager, where I take care of the Logisitcs Platform, and develop solutions for solving NP Hard problems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem">Vehicle Routing Problems</a> on a larger scale.Â 

Over more than a decade **(13+ years**) I have played multiple roles in the Software industry, **starting as a Software engineer, moving to many leadership roles, and as an Entrepreneur**. I really enjoy wearing multiple hats, which have not only given me the opportunity to understand each aspect of the Software development life cycle but also made me mature enough to understand the perspective of different stakeholders.
